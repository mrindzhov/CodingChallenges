- Struggle to solve before peeking at a solution - Chew and digest the problem to really understand it well - Try to see if there is any pattern

- Don't memorize the solution. Bad strategy
- Really Know what you don't know
- Start with easy level and build on to get a Solid foundation
- Implement Common data structure by hand
- Use pen paper to work out the problem
- Time yourself. Use the Pomodoro technique
- Take 5 min break after every 25 min
- Take half-hour break after 2 hour
- Have a realistic study schedule that you will follow.
- Solving one to three problems every day.

I don't agree. Peek at the solution of 20 most common problems of each area like arrays, graphs, puzzles, etc. Implement it with copy paste, run them. That will give you some direction and problem experience, big O complexity experience. After that, peek the solution half of the time, then make the effort the other half. You will double your rate of exposition to new problems.
